# To remove the difficulty of calculating CGPA

<p>
After the examination, the majority of students can anticipate the outcome. Likewise for me. 
After completing the semester's final exams, I attempt to calculate my possible SGPA. 
Calculating the SGPA is a tedious undertaking. Therefore, I developed this basic web calculator. 
This project's primary objective is to simplify the calculation of CGPA.
Calculation method is based on the system of <strong>Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology</strong> <a href="https://www.ruet.ac.bd/" target="_blank">RUET</a>
